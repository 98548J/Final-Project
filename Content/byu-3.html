                            Briefly describe a time that your efforts have fallen short, a goal was not 
                            accomplished, or an aspiration was not achieved. What steps did you take to 
                            recover from this defeat? What resources did you use? How and why are you 
                            different today?
                        </p>

                            The tension in the room is like a drawn bow; everyone pulls the bowstring tighter, 
                            but nobody knows where the arrow points. It's the state tournament of the VEX 
                            robotics competition. Here, the fortunate few who emerge victorious will compete 
                            on the world stage. My team, 98548J, has one last chance of qualifying for the world 
                            championship: the Design Award.

                            The announcer begins to read, "...and the winner of the Design Award is... 2131R!"

                            The arrow flies straight into my heart.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With the sting of defeat fresh on our minds, we trudge back to our fortress, hang 
                            our armor, bandage our pride wounds, and call an official (robotics) meeting to 
                            order. We will assess what went wrong over the season and how to fix these mistakes 
                            before our next conquest. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            One issue we need to address is how we communicate as a team. Because each team member 
                            specializes in their roles within the team, it's easy to become hyper-focused on 
                            our work without considering the impact of our work on everyone else's. Using experienced 
                            teams as an example, we saw how they avoided this problem. To escape this activity trap, 
                            we have committed to sharing frequent progress reports throughout the season with each 
                            other. Our communication will now be as sharp as a honed blade.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Another issue we need to hammer out is how we document our work. Previously, we would 
                            only add to our engineering notebook in retrospect. Again, we saw the answer in some 
                            experienced teams. What we will be doing, instead, is recording our plans for the robot 
                            before we set them into action. Because of this, our notebook stays up-to-date and accurate. 
                            Our engineering notebook now acts as a shield; it defends any progress we've made in 
                            battle (I'm referring to robotics, of course) while serving as a springboard toward potential 
                            success.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            With my sword of communication grasped firmly in one hand and our notebook shield in 
                            the other, I'm ready. Armed with these fantastically pragmatic tools, we march to battle 
                            once again.
