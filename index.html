                        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
                        <p class="justify">Embarking on the exciting journey of college applications as a high school senior,
                                I found myself presented with the unique opportunity to apply to Brigham Young University, a place 
                                where I hope to further my education and personal growth. In order to gain admission to this esteemed 
                                institution, I was tasked with the challenging yet fulfilling endeavor of composing several essays 
                                that encapsulate who I am and what I hope to achieve during my time at BYU. This webpage serves as 
                                a digital repository for my application essays, a collection of my thoughts, experiences, and 
                                aspirations, providing a glimpse into my journey towards joining the vibrant community at BYU. 
                                Through these essays, I hope to convey not only my academic abilities but also my passion, character, 
                                and dedication to becoming a valuable member of the BYU family. Each essay is a unique facet of my 
                                identity and an integral part of my pursuit of higher education at Brigham Young University. Below, 
                                you will find links to each of my essays, each one representing a chapter in my story of becoming a
