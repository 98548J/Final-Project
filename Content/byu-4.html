                            We strive to create a rich and varied educational environment through admitting students with a wide range of:

                        <h1>Essay</h1>
                        <p>
                            As students meander towards their next class, the sound of chatter skips 
                            aimlessly through the hallway of our school. Suddenly, the sound trips -- 
                            completely face-planting. I tripped the chatter with a shout:  "Hey, Hunter!" 
                            "Hey, Caleb!" Hunter exclaims back. We both grin as we clap our hands together. 
                            Did one of us win the lottery, a free cruise? Nope, I just wanted to say hi.
                        
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The reason I do this is simple: The goal of making my friends smile; if that 
                            requires making a fool of myself in the hallway, so be it. Further, I want my 
                            friends to feel genuinely happy when they see me, so I try to be a real friend: 
                            being honest with them, listening to them, encouraging them, and serving them. 
                            In turn, they reward me with a grin.
                        
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Not even my teachers are exempt from this treatment: during lunch today, my 
                            calculus teacher and I tried to see if a summation formula we had made during 
                            class matched Gauss' summation formula. Similarly, my love of engineering has 
                            sparked some fun after-class conversations with my physics teacher -- have you 
                            ever wanted to know the inertia of a flywheel with some holes in it?
                        
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I also have a love for music. Through music, I have had many opportunities to 
                            serve (and entertain) my peers by playing my saxophone in Christmas programs, 
                            dinner dances, and talent shows.
                        
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            It's my outgoing nature and love of math, physics, engineering, and music that I 
                            will use to contribute to my community.
                        
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I look down the hall and see someone else I know.
                        
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I grin -- perfect.
