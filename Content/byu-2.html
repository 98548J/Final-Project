                            Have you become aware of significant needs in your family, school, and/or 
                            community? Please explain how you have worked toward meeting those needs.

                            It's a chilly October morning, and my breath puffs into faint, little clouds 
                            as I breathe into my hands. After a few yanks of the lawnmower's starter cord, 
                            it roars to life. Now I'm fighting the lawn mower -- performing an awkward 
                            crabwalk to keep it from sliding sideways down the dewy hill. With a wry smile, 
                            I'm surprised to notice that I don't mind my soaked socks or numb hands. Why? 
                            Because the lawn I'm mowing is not my own.
                        </p>

                            I am blessed to have a very proactive family. My grandparents are a great example 
                            of this: from hosting family reunions, doing family history work, and finding 
                            names for proxy baptism, they always find ways to bless those around them. However, 
                            two years ago, my grandpa began having some health issues. Because of this, 
                            he needed somebody to take his place in caring for their spacious lawn (also weeding 
                            or planting occasionally). When my parents told me about his situation, I knew the 
                            responsibility would fall on me. I tend to stay very busy as a teenager -- "free time" 
                            is a foreign concept to me. Since I didn't have a regular time when I could mow their 
                            lawn, I had to sacrifice some time for them. Usually, I go to robotics after school, 
                            so I take a day off from robotics every week to mow their lawn. In the summer, I 
                            would mow their lawn on my days off from work. 
                        </p>

                            The part I enjoy the most is when my grandpa walks me home; I don't get many 
                            opportunities to talk with him, so these are the moments I cherish.
                        </p>

                            And so, on a brisk October morning, we walk.
