                            While you have most likely been involved in many different activities, you will have an opportunity to write about 
                            two activities that will help us get to know you as an individual. You will be able to describe the activity, how 
                            long you have participated in it, and how you have benefited from your participation.

                            The clouds must have a sense of humor. My opponent has served all of his points in cool 
                            shade. And now, with a sigh, I glance up to where I get to place my ball for my serve: 
                            the sun smirks down mischievously. I look away and start my pre-serve ritual: I bounce 
                            the ball once, then twice, and line up my center of gravity above my left foot.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I first played tennis with my family when I was little. My sister played tennis through 
                            high school, and I would practice with her. I decided to follow in her footsteps; I 
                            made our tennis team my sophomore year.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Because our team is so small, I play against players much more skilled than myself. 
                            Playing against people better than me was hard during my first year. However, these 
                            are the matches where I grew the most.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Tennis has a lot of depth; I can play tennis for the rest of my life, and there will 
                            always be room to improve. The message in this is subtle, but it's significant: I can't 
                            compare myself to others who have played tennis their entire lives. The only person I 
                            can compare against is -- myself.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            It is frustrating to be working on something only to find you don't have any more desire 
                            to continue. My experiences in tennis have taught me to persevere even when the sun is 
                            staring you straight in the face.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            As I prepare to take my serve, I repeat what I know: Never back down; I can only become 
                            better. I can't compare myself; I can only improve myself. With these thoughts in mind, 
                            I shift back my weight and toss the ball.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During middle school, one of my friends who had done robotics for a year asked me why 
                            I wasn't in robotics. "We have a robotics program?" I asked doubtfully. "Umm... yeah," 
                            said my friend; he then described what the program was like. "Sweet!" I thought to 
                            myself -- this was going to be right up my alley.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Robotics demands a lot from its members; last year alone, I logged around 600 hours. 
                            We compete in more tournaments than most schools, and these competitions cost money: 
                            registration fees, travel, food, lodging, etc.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            How I spend my time in between competitions determines our success. Because it isn't 
                            always clear how we should spend our time, we hold regular team meetings to discuss 
                            what we need to do and when. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            When I first started robotics, it was a struggle to listen to other people's ideas. 
                            Recently, though, I've come to value other people's ideas -- even if they weren't 
                            perfect, neither were mine! 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In the heat of the moment during those incredibly stressful matches, effective communication 
                            with your alliance partner (a team who helps you complete the tasks) is critical. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Aside from competing at the world championship twice and the 44 trophies I have earned 
                            over three years, I have learned to order my priorities, respect a schedule, collaborate 
                            effectively with others, and stay calm in stressful situations.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My footsteps echo off the faded brick wall of our school as I jog to the door of the 
                            robotics room. Ready for another day at the grind -- I open the door.
                        </p>
