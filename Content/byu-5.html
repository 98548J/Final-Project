                            A BYU education will be spiritually strengthening. BYU students have a unique opportunity 
                            to seek learning by study and by faith. Describe the reasons you want to learn in an 
                            environment like this.

                        <h1>Essay</h1>
                        <p>
                            Beep! Beep. Beep. Bee.... My hand, through some primal, instinctual mechanism, 
                            finally finds the snooze button. My roommate, Layne, is sitting up. "You ready?" 
                            I ask with a tired grin. "Oh, It's on!" Layne murmurs back. Today marks the day 
                            I come home from FSY; Layne and I have agreed to wake up early today (5 AM) to 
                            play one last game of pool together. On the main floor now, Layne lines up his cue, 
                            preparing to take the break shot. In this moment, I begin to think about my time 
                            here.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I was able to lift people's spirits by creating and nurturing friendships. I witnessed 
                            people step out of their comfort zone for the benefit of another. Some people shared 
                            their testimonies, and others grew one. We were all there for each other. Simply 
                            being in an environment like this makes you want to better yourself and those around 
                            you.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Actions of faith like this are encouraged by the gospel, but they also support learning! 
                            D&C 88:118 can help us put things in a celestial perspective; our education is not 
                            strictly a means to an end; it is an end in itself.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            When you gather children of god in an environment that encourages spiritual growth, 
                            fierce things happen; we build each other up, become leaders, and celebrate others' 
                            successes. When these students graduate, just like when a cue ball finally makes an 
                            impact, they send shockwaves through the world.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            With a deft stroke of his cue, Layne takes the shot.
                        </p>
