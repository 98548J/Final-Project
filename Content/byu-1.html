                            Describe a topic, idea, or experience that you find so engaging that it makes 
                            you lose all track of time. What have you done to learn more or engage further 
                            in the topic, idea or experience? What resources do you use to learn more?

                            With anticipation, I execute my SPH fluid simulation; obediently, my program 
                            begins to process as I have commanded. Myriads of particles chaotically bounce 
                            around in the mathematical prison I have created. Unfortunately, this is where 
                            the fun ends. A few moments later, my program crashed. I'm trying to implement 
                            a GPU-friendly, regional sorting algorithm.

                            When I program, I'll frequently learn bits of information through quick Google 
                            searches. However, I knew this would only get me so far. As such, I have invested 
                            in programming books: three on Python, one on C#, and one on C++.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition to monetary investments, My involvement in competitive robotics has 
                            allowed me to flourish in programming. Through robotics, I learned how to use 
                            powerful tools such as Git Hub and VSC. In robotics, I get to collaborate with 
                            my team while programming. Because of this, I have realized the value of clean, 
                            maintainable code. Working in a team has also taught me the value of the engineering 
                            design process; documenting our work increased my productivity drastically.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am prepared for this! After hours of debugging and hair-pulling, I realized the 
                            mathematical prison I created was not impenetrable. I've been allowing particles to 
                            escape my prison; these escapees are unsortable by my algorithm. I corrected my 
                            physics engine, the warden of my prison, by checking for escaped particles only 
                            after calculating their new positions. Confident I had eradicated the bug, I ran 
                            my program one last time.
